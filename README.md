The task is to write a WordCount utility. The program can count the number of lines and words in the file and display file's size in bytes.

[Lab 2](https://github.com/shvetsovart/ITMO-Programming-1-sem/blob/lab2/lab2.cpp "Lab 2") - [Task](https://github.com/shvetsovart/ITMO-Programming-1-sem/blob/main/C.%20%D0%9B%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0%202.%20uint1024_t.pdf "Task") [uint1024_t type]

The task is to write a uint1024_t type. The program can read and output a long number, form uint1024_t from int, add, subtract and multiply numbers of uint1024_t type.

[Lab 3](https://github.com/shvetsovart/ITMO-Programming-1-sem/blob/lab3/lab3.cpp "Lab 3") - [Task](https://github.com/shvetsovart/ITMO-Programming-1-sem/blob/main/C.%20%D0%9B%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0%203.%20%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7%20%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B2%20%D1%81%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0.pdf "Task") [Analysis of NASA server logs]
