Laboratory works on the subject "Programming (C language)" at ITMO

[Lab 1](https://github.com/shvetsovart/ITMO-Programming-1-sem/blob/lab1/lab1.c "Lab 1") - [Task](https://github.com/shvetsovart/ITMO-Programming-1-sem/blob/main/C.%20%D0%9B%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0%201.%20%D0%A3%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B0%20WordCount.pdf "Task") [WordCount Utility]

The task is to write a WordCount utility. The program counts the number of lines and words in the file and displays file's size in bytes.

[Lab 2](https://github.com/shvetsovart/ITMO-Programming-1-sem/blob/lab2/lab2.cpp "Lab 2") - [Task](https://github.com/shvetsovart/ITMO-Programming-1-sem/blob/main/C.%20%D0%9B%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0%202.%20uint1024_t.pdf "Task") [uint1024_t type]

The task is to write a uint1024_t type. The program reads and outputs a long number, forms uint1024_t from int, adds, subtracts and multiplies numbers of uint1024_t type.

[Lab 3](https://github.com/shvetsovart/ITMO-Programming-1-sem/blob/lab3/lab3.cpp "Lab 3") - [Task](https://github.com/shvetsovart/ITMO-Programming-1-sem/blob/main/C.%20%D0%9B%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0%203.%20%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7%20%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B2%20%D1%81%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0.pdf "Task") [Analysis of NASA server logs]

The task is to prepare a list of requests that ended in 5xx error, with number of failed requests, and to find the time window (with duration parameterized) when the number of requests to the server was maximum.

[Lab 4](https://github.com/shvetsovart/ITMO-Programming-1-sem/blob/lab4/lab4.c "Lab 4") - [Task](https://github.com/shvetsovart/ITMO-Programming-1-sem/blob/main/C.%20%D0%9B%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0%204.%20%D0%A0%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%20%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B8%20mp3.pdf "Task") [Mp3 file meta-information editor]

The task is to write 3 commands to work with the mp3 meta-information: show, get and set. 
- show - displays all meta-information in the form of a table
- get=prop_name - displays a specific field of meta-information named prop_name
- set=prop_name value=prop_value - exposes the value of a specific meta-information field named prop_name in prop_value

[Lab 5](https://github.com/shvetsovart/ITMO-Programming-1-sem/blob/lab5/lab5.c "Lab 5") - [Task](https://github.com/shvetsovart/ITMO-Programming-1-sem/blob/main/C.%20%D0%9B%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0%205.%20%D0%98%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%20%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BD%D1%8C.pdf "Task") [Conway's Game Of Life]

The task is to write Conway's Game Of Life. The program (in addition to a .py program that collects all bmp files into one gif) can output gifs with gradiented lifes and bug (feature) gifs that have glitches and explosions.
